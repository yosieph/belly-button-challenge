# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The site has the following elements:

    A test subject drop-down menu that is dynamically populated based upon the sample data
    A panel and three graphs are dynamically created based upon the subject selected:
        A Demographic Panel that lists the subject's information
        A Bar Graph that illustrates the ten most prevalent OTU's found for this subject
        A Bubble Graph that illustrates the OTUs and their relative sample values
        A Gauge that shows the washing frequency

This dashboard is hosted here:
